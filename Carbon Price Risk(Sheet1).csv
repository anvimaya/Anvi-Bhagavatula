"In today’s RGGI regime, a representative carbon price is around the mid-$20s. I am anchoring the mean to around $24.00, given the historic prices of carbon on RGGI standards.  ",,,,,,,
"Given the policy-driven and volatile nature of carbon markets, I didn’t rely on a single forecast. Instead, I used recent RGGI data to anchor a central price level and ran a Monte Carlo simulation to quantify the distribution of possible future prices and associated risk.",,,,,,,
"Renewable energy resources are better in this scenario as the price of carbon is very volatile in the current and predicted regimes, and therefore, avoiding an increase in cost, is beneficial. ",,,,,,,
